# Assets Directory

This directory contains all game assets:

## Sprites
The `sprites` directory should contain all game graphics:
- Player sprites (idle, run, jump, fall animations)
- Platform textures
- Enemy sprites
- Collectible animations
- Background images
- UI elements

## Sounds
The `sounds` directory should contain all game audio:
- `jump.wav`: Player jump sound
- `coin.wav`: Collecting coin sound  
- `hurt.wav`: Player getting hit sound
- `level_complete.wav`: Level completion sound

If you want to add custom sprites and sounds, place them in the appropriate directories.
The game will automatically look for these files at runtime.
